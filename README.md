# dispGeoPT
## Description
Matlab script to characterize displacement (mean and uncertainty distribution) of slip profiles from geolocated points.

Computes:
* net, horizontal, and vertical displacement components
* rupture width
* aperture width

Uncertainty quantification from:
* projection window width
* projection point sampling distribution
* projection points' location uncertainty
* rupture location
* rupture azimuth
