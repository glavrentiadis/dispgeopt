# dispGeoPT
Matlab script to characterize displacement slip profiles from geolocated points

Computes:
* net, horizontal, and vertical displacement components
* rupture width
* aperture width

Uncertainty quantification from:
* projection points' location uncertainty
* projection width
* rupture location
* rupture azimuth
